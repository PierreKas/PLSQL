 PROCEDURES

1. Write a procedure to update all the students in the Information technology department to Arts

CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE update_IT_students IS

BEGIN
UPDATE students SET department_id = 3 WHERE department_id =2;
END update_IT_students;
/

execute update_IT_students ();

2. Write a procedure which will be assigned students to a given department according to the date he/she was registered and 
the age  he/she has :
January - February (age<25 years) : IT
March - April (Between 25 and 30) : Computer science
May - June(Between 20 and 30): Arts
>30 : Litterature (no matter his registration date)

And finally prints the result in the following format:
Your name is .<stu_fname  stu_lname>... you were registered on .<reg_date>.. and you have been assigned in ..<department_name>..

CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE updt_stu (code VARCHAR) IS

reg_date students.registration_date%type;
age students.stu_age%type;
department students.department_ID%type;

CURSOR display_stu_info IS SELECT students.stu_fname,  students.stu_lname,  students.registration_date, department.department_name FROM students 
JOIN department
ON department.id=students.department_id 
WHERE code=stu_code;
BEGIN

SELECT registration_date INTO reg_date FROM students WHERE code=stu_code;
SELECT stu_age INTO age FROM students WHERE code=stu_code;
SELECT department_ID INTO department FROM students WHERE code=stu_code;

IF reg_date BETWEEN TO_DATE('2022-01-01',' YYYY-MM-DD') AND TO_DATE('2022-02-28', 'YYYY-MM-DD')  AND age < 25 THEN
UPDATE students SET department_id = 2 WHERE code=stu_code;
